<h2>HELMET DETECTION SYSTEM</h2>
<br>
<p>The annotated images are given as input to YOLOv3 model to 
train for the custom classes. The weights generated after 
training are used to load the model. Once this is done, an 
image is given as input. </p>
<p>The model detects all the five classes 
trained. From this we obtain the information regarding 
person riding motorbike. </p>

<h2>SALARY PREDICTION SYSTEM</h2>
<br>
<p>salary prediction using the machine learning algorithm. 
This model predicts the salary of the employee based on the year of experience of employee.</p>
 
<p>This is a regression problem which is solved using a LinearRegression.</p>

<h2>STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
<br>
<p>Schools and Universities are the foundation of knowledge and an educational body on which students rely upon.
They need to maintain a proper database of its students to keep all the updated records and easily share information with students.</p>
 
<p>it's It's a desktop application that using Gui .It uses DBMS concepts to properly maintain all 
student details .</p>
